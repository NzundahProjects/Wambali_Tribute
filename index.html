                <span>Wambali Mkandawire</span> who was also popular by the name <span>“Mteweti”</span>(which is a Tumbuka word meaning;
                 the servant; precisely “servant of God”), was a Malawian Jazz singer .According to the 
                 data from Wikipedia, <span>Wambali</span> was a Malawian nationality who was born in 1951, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
                 Wambali had an authentic approach to music which makes his music to have a unique taste that
                  makes most of us enjoy listening to his songs all day. Sadly on 31, January, 2021 
                  we lost him due to the covid-19 pandemic, however he will always remain in our 
                  hearts through his soothing music and may his soul keep resting in peace.

            <h5>My Opinion about Wambali:</h5>
            <p>
                I personally think that ,<span>Wambali</span> was one of the great musicians that Malawi has ever been blessed
                 with. His songs in my view had meaning and were so soothing. I think this explains why many people mourned 
                 him allot on the day that he passed on.
